# User Stories: 

### Version 2:
- as a user, I want to be able to report of range of dates and be shown all the tasks within those date, so that i can narrow down dates that i want to see
  - as a user, when i click the report button i want a pop up box to appear to select dates, so that i do not need to navigate to a new page to do this function.
  - as a user, I want error handling so that i can not make the start date be before the end date, to avoid any errors when running the application
  - as a user, I want the report of dates to refresh the screen and label the top with the dates selected, so that i can easily see the dates without having to do to a new page
- as a user, I want to be able to press priority and see my dates rearranged from time most spent on a task to least spent on a task, so i can see what has consumed most of my time
  - as a user, when i un-click the priority button, the dates will go back to being ordered by date (and not time), so that i can have flexibility with the way i view my tasks
