# User Stories: 

### Version 1:
- as a user, I want to be able to record a task using the date, time (to and from), a description, and a tag because I want to be able to keep track of things I need to do.
- as a user, I want a user friendly application, so that it is easy for me to navigate.
- as a user, I want to be able to query a task(s) based on date, description, or tag, so that i can narrow down what tasks I see.
